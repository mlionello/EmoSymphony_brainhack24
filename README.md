Music has a unique ability to evoke emotions, but whatâ€™s actually happening in the brain when we feel something while listening to it?
This project dives into that question using fMRI data from participants listening to music during fMRI scans. 

Current goals:

- Understand Brain Connectivity: Figure out which brain networks are involved in processing emotions while listening to music, and track how these networks change over time.
- Link Music Features to Brain Activity: Use machine learning and causal analysis to see how different music features (like temporal, spectral, and emotional patterns) impact brain connections and dynamics.
